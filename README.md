> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> ### Why I Built IcoDev
> As a developer building my personal portfolio, I kept running into a frustrating problem ‚Äî I just wanted to add clean, high-quality icons for tech tools like React, VS Code, Figma, or Python. But the process was a hassle:
>
> - I had to search manually for each icon
> - Download it
> - Remove the background
> - Resize it so it doesn't mess with layout
> - And still hope it looks good across platforms...
>
> It was a tedious, repetitive job for something that should be plug-and-play ‚Äî like how Bootstrap Icons or Google Material Icons work. But those don‚Äôt cover developer- and designer-specific tools.
>
> So I built IcoDev.
>
> A platform that gives you beautiful, HD SVG icons for programming languages, dev tools, and design software ‚Äî instantly usable, clean, and CDN-ready.
